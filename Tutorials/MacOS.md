### How to install and run Node-Hill on MacOS!

##### Step 1, prepare the tools.

To run Node-Hill you'll need **NodeJS**, to install it, use the command line tool, **Brew**.

Open up a terminal and type in:
```bash
brew update
```
This command will update the packages you have.
And now lets install NodeJS.
```bash
brew install node
```
This should install NodeJS in our system and now you should be able of following the rest of the Node-Hill Guide.

#### Brew does not exist!

Install it with this command then:
```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Then refer to the first step.

 #### Ruby does not exist!

If the last command did not work, you'll have to install **XCode Tools**, a set of tools for developers by Apple.

Install this and then try again to install **Brew**.
