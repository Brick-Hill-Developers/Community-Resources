[Full documentation](https://ethanent.github.io/phin/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ethanent/phin) | [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phin)


## Simple Usage

```javascript
const p = require('phin')

const res = await p('https://ethanent.me')

console.log(res.body)
```

Note that the above should be in an async context! phin also provides an unpromisified version of the library.


## Install

```
npm install phin
```


## Why phin?

phin is **trusted** by some really important projects. The hundreds of contributors at [Less](https://github.com/less/less.js), for example, depend on phin as part of their development process.

Also, phin is super **lightweight**. Like **99.8% smaller than request** lightweight. To compare to other libraries, see [phin vs. the Competition](https://github.com/ethanent/phin/blob/master/README.md#phin-vs-the-competition).

## Quick Demos

Simple POST:

```js
await p({
	url: 'https://ethanent.me',
	method: 'POST',
	data: {
		hey: 'hi'
	}
})
```

### Unpromisified Usage

```js
const p = require('phin').unpromisified

p('https://ethanent.me', (err, res) => {
	if (!err) console.log(res.body)
})
```

Simple parsing of JSON:

```js
// (In async function in this case.)

const res = await p({
	'url': 'https://ethanent.me/name',
	'parse': 'json'
})

console.log(res.body.first)
```

### Default Options

```js
const ppostjson = p.defaults({
	'method': 'POST',
	'parse': 'json',
	'timeout': 2000
})

// In async function...

const res = await ppostjson('https://ethanent.me/somejson')
// ^ An options object could also be used here to set other options.

// Do things with res.body?
```

### Custom Core HTTP Options

phin allows you to set [core HTTP options](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_url_options_callback).

```js
await p({
	'url': 'https://ethanent.me/name',
	'core': {
		'agent': myAgent // Assuming you'd already created myAgent earlier.
	}
})
```

## phin vs. the Competition

phin is a very lightweight library, yet it contains all of the common HTTP client features included in competing libraries!
